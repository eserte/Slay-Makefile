=head1 NAME

Slay::Makefile - Wrapper to Slay::Maker that reads the rules from a file

=cut

our $VERSION = '0.14';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Slay::Maker> is a make engine that uses perl declaration syntax for
rules, including regular expressions for targets and anonymous subs
for targets, dependencies, and actions.  This C<Slay::Makefile>
wrapper allows for the rules to be contained within a SlayMakefile
file whose syntax is similar to that of a normal Makefile.

=head1 FILE SYNTAX

The file syntax is a series of statements where each statement is one of:

   <perl-block>

   <target(s)> : <dependencies>
           <actions>

   [-] include <filename>

   # Comment

<perl-block> has the syntax:

   {
       <perl-statement(s)>
   }

where <perl-statement(s)> is any series of perl statements.

<target(s>) is either a space-delimited set of targets, each of which
is either a literal string or a <perl-block> which returns an array,
each of which is either a literal string or a regular expression
('Regexp') reference (C<qr/.../>).  A literal string can contain a
C<%> character to act as a wild-card, just as with GNU make.  However,
the Regexp feature is more general, since it can capture more than one
substring and use the values C<$!>, C<$2>, ... inside the
dependencies.  Note that only one target can realistically contain
wildcards, whether in a Regexp or using C<%>, since there is only one
set of C<$1>, C<$2>, ... variables.

The colon separating a <perl-block> for <target(s)> must be on the
same line as the closing brace of the <perl-block>.

<dependencies> is either a space-delimited set of dependency strings
or a <perl-block> which returns an array of dependencies (or a
combination). The dependency string can contain C<$1>, C<$2>, ..., or
C<%>, which is synonymous with C<$1> and C<${TARGET}>, which gets the
target name.  They can also use any scalar global variables previously
defined in a <perl-block>.  A dependency <perl-block> is called with
the values C<($make, $target, $matches)>, where C<$make> is a
C<Slay::Maker> object, C<$target> is the target name, and C<$matches> is
a reference to an array containing the captured values from that
target's Regexp (if any).

The colon separating a <perl-block> for <dependencies> must be on the
same line as the opening brace of the <perl-block>.

<actions> is a series of zero or more action "lines", where each
action is either a string, which will be executed inside a shell, a
perl anonymous array, which is executed without a shell (see
IPC::Run), or a <perl-block>.  For purposes of this discussion, a
"line" continues as long as the lines of string action end with "\" or
as long as a perl anonymous array or <perl-block> do not have their
closing punctuation.  A string action can use the strings C<$1>,
C<$2>, ..., for the matches, C<$DEP0>, C<$DEP1>, ..., for the
dependencies, and C<$TARGET>, which represents the target being built.
For make enthusiasts, C<$*> can be used for C<$1>.  A string action
can also use any scalar global variables previously defined in a
<perl-block>.  An action <perl-block> is called with the values
C<($make, $target, $deps, $matches)>, where C<$make> is a C<Slay::Maker>
object, C<$target> is the target name, C<$deps> is a reference to the
array of dependencies and $matches is a reference to an array
containing the captured values from that target's Regexp (if any).

An include line includes the content of a file with <filename> as a
SlayMakefile file.  If there is no such file, C<Slay::Makefile> tries
to build it using rules that have already been presented.  If there is
no such rule, C<Slay::Makefile> exits with an error unless there was a
C<-> before the "include".

The equivalent of make's defines are handled by setting perl global
variables.  Each main <perl-block> is executed in the order it appears
in the file, but any <perl-block> that is part of a dependency or
action is evaluated lazily, so that all the global variables will have
been set.  A main <perl-block> is called with the value
C<($makefile)>, where C<$makefile> is the C<Slay::Makefile> object,
so that such code can, for example, recursively call the parse method.

Comments begin with a C<#> and extend to the end of line.

Continuation lines can be specified by putting a backslash at the end
of the previous line, provided however, that continuation lines are
unnecessary (automatic) within a perl block or perl anonymous array.
Although continuation lines in a perl dependency or action must begin
with at least one space so a that the parser does not think a new rule
is beginning, the minimum indentation is removed prior to evaluation
so that HEREIS strings can be used.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=cut

use Carp;
use Slay::Maker 0.04;

=item C<new([$options])>

Class method.  Creates a new C<Slay::Makefile> object using the
optional C<$options> argument.  It also process the following options
out of C<$options>:

  strict:      If 0, do not enforce strict checking on perl blocks

=cut

sub new {
    my ($class, $options) = @_;

    my $self = bless {}, $class;
    $options = {} unless $options;

    $self->{maker}   = new Slay::Maker({options => $options});
    $self->{options} = $options;

    return $self;
}

=item C<maker>

Method.  Returns the C<Slay::Maker> object used by this
C<Slay::Makefile> object.

=cut

sub maker : method {
    return $_[0]{maker};
}

=item C<make (@targets)>

Method.  Calls the C<Slay::Maker> object's make method to build the list
of targets.  If no targets are given, makes the targets of the first rule 
with constant targets.

=cut

# '
sub make : method {
    my $self = shift;
    
    $self->_croak('No targets specified and no default target provided')
	if ! @_ && ! $self->{first};
    $self->{maker}->make(@_ ? @_ : $self->{first}->targets);
}

=item C<parse ($filename)>

Method.  Parses file C<$filename> as a SlayMakefile and populates the
C<Slay::Maker> object with its rules.  Returns a reference to an array
of parse errors.

=cut

sub parse : method {
    my ($self, $filename) = @_;

    open IN, $filename or croak "Cannot open $filename";
    my $string = join '', <IN>;
    close IN;
    return $self->parse_string($string, $filename);
}

=item C<parse_string ($string, [$filename, [$lineno]])>

Method.  Parses C<$string> as a SlayMakefile.  If C<$filename> and/or
C<$lineno> arguments are provided, they are used for more detailed
error reporting.  Returns a reference to an array of parse errors.

=head1 LIMITATIONS

The parsing of perl blocks is only semi-smart.  In particular,
unbalanced braces within comments or strings can cause parsing to end
prematurely or not at all.  For example,

  {
     # This comment has an unbalanced }
  }
  {
     "This string has an unbalanced {";
  }

will not parse correctly.  The first block will stop parsing at the
end of the comment and the second will continue swallowing text after
the end of its closing brace.  As long as the total number of {'s
exceeds the total number lf }'s, parsing continues.  You can always
overcome this problem by putting comments in judicious places:

  {
     # Compensate with {
     # This comment has an unbalanced }
  }
  {
     "This string has an unbalanced {";  # Compensate with }
  }
